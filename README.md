# fuzzy-sinking-chair-of-vincent--Demo
my first repositotory; my first demo
---
this one is a result of my very first steps in learning kTurtle scripting language.
- it is an animation of sinking chair.
- in order to make it running you would need working kTurtle application (a part of KDE project).
- just open it and the interpreter would run it for you.

thanks to Wikipedia for an inspiration[^1] and acting character!!!
